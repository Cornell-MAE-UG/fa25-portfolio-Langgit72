## [Fluid Mechanical Dissection - Langston Johnson]

[Fluid Mechanical Dissection Video](https://youtu.be/sVpQv9G_dB8 "Triple Action Paddle Board Pump")

In this dissection I was responsible for taking images and videos of the pump dissection. I completed the dissection of the action-select dial. By taking the nozzle apart and noting where air-flowed during each pump cycle I was able to draw the streamline diagrams for each different mode of operation. This involved identifying the regions of the pump that were at high pressure in some operation modes, and at ambient pressure in anothers. I also identified where the check valve was been located, as well as what section of the pump the pressure gauge was measuring static pressure, which was used to identify which section of the pump was connected to the tube and paddle board. I also performed calculations for the reynolds nummber for the air moving through the pump tube, using the mean flow approximation. Using my value for reynolds number of the air as it moved thorugh the hose in tandem with the surface roughness of a smooth pipe, I determined the change in Bernoulli's constant for the fluid after it has been pumped, quantiying the change of static pressure due to viscous losses from the hose.
